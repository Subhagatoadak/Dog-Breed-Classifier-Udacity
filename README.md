## Dog-Breed-Classifier-Udacity-

This is a solution to my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree project where I have implemented CNN and Transfer learning.

## Project Overview 
In this project, I have implemented a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for my app. My major goal in the project was to successfully implement the understanding of my course materials and then use my experience to tune the model in such a way that I have maximum accuracy.
